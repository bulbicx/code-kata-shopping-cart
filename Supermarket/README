I spent two hours to complete the task, but to be honest i lost time on using the correct program to code. I started using sublimeText instead of IntelliJ, so I lost time on figuring out how to run the program from sublimeText, forgetting that is just a text editor and i cannot run the program with. As soon as i figured out what to use, IntelliJ in this case, I started to check if what I was doing was right. The task itself was not difficult I just had confusion at the start, not having used java for a while, but then I got the program running and it works as expected, unfortunately it looks the program has a bug and it shows that after an offer ia applied then if any of the same item are left, then those one are left out. As it was required to do the task in less than two hours, i had to leave it there and to be honest about it. I created two java classes, one for the program itself and the other for testing the code using the Main method. I started the program declaring variable to be used afterwards. I created two for loop: one for counting a, b, c, d and the other for checking if the letter is present and if it is, then apply the offer if it can be made, otherwise just add the cost. If letter a or b are present then there is another for loop, inside the previous one, which goes up to the lenght of the letters counted. If for example letter a is counted four times than there is a first if statement checking if the count can be a divisor of 3(meaning the offer can be applied) if it is applied, then 3 is removed from the count, as the offer has been applied. If there are any left they will be calculated using the normal cost.
